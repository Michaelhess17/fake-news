REFERENCE CLAIM: North Koreans beleive Kim Jong Il was super human at golf.

DESCRIPTION: This claim has many different forms.  In some forms, Kim Jong Il hit 5 holes in one the first time he played golf; in other versions he hit 18 holes in one; and in other versions he "merely" hit underpar.  The key feature that all of these claims share is that it is Kim Jong Il (not another leader) who is amazing at golf, and that North Koreans all believe this story unquestioningly.

There are several reasons to think this story is false, and experts widely agree that it is false.  First, the original story cites only unnamed sources in North Korea, and the reporter was not a North Korea specialist.  Second, the game of golf is widely associated with capitalism, and so it would be highly out of character for the leader of a socialist country to brag about prowess at a capitalist sport.
